# Data Consulting Agency (DCA) needs you to develop software to
#match their clients. The list of clients is in a text file with one line per client. The
#following is an example of six clients although you should assume the client list to be
#larger.
#John Smith, M, 27, F, 24, 29, movies, tennis, walking, computers
#Alison Jones, F, 25, M, 26, 32, walking, golf, movies, reading
#Brian Adams, M, 30, F, 23, 28, golf, cricket
#Chris Jones, M, 27, F, 30, 40, golf, reading
#Paul Fulton, M, 23, M, 21, 25, football, reading
#Peter Jackson, M, 25, M, 20, 30, golf, walking, movies
#The file specifies information about the client. For example, John Smith is male, 27
#years old and wishes to meet a female aged between 24-29 inclusive; his interests
#are movies, tennis, walking and computers.
#Write the code to process the client list, assumed to be in a file named clients.txt into a
#dictionary called clients. The name of the client is the dictionary key which you can assume
#to be unique and the remaining client information i.e. the dictionary value should be a list.
#Clients are compatible if each one is of the gender and age range that the other is seeking.
#For the purposes of this question you can ignore common interests. No-one should be
#matched to themselves. Write the code to a function check_match that accepts a clientâ€™s
#name as a string, determines suitable matches and outputs the matches to the screen e.g.
#assuming the client was Alison Jones, potential matches would be John Smith, Brian Adams
#and Chris Jones.
